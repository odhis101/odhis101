# Hello, world! 👋🏾

## About Me

I'm Joshua, a Kenyan software developer specializing in React Native, React, and Node.js. 🇰🇪

## What I'm Working On

- 🚑 **Health-Wetu:** an ambulance app where users can quickly call for medical assistance in case of an emergency.
- 🤫 *Classified Projects:* shh, they're a secret for now. 👀

## Skills

- 🚀 React Native
- ⚛️ React
- 🐍 Python
- 🔥 Node.js

### React vs. Next.js

React is like a good, reliable friend that's always there for you. Next.js is like that friend's cool cousin who tries to impress you but ultimately falls short. 😜

### Java

I know Java, but let's not talk about it... 🙈
